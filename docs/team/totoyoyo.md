## Project: MeetBuddy

### Overview
**MeetBuddy** is a desktop app optimised for people who want to organise their meetings and their contacts.
They can store both meetings and contacts, view the meetings scheduled for the week, and take note of which contacts
they are meeting up with. 

Below are my contributions to the project.

### Contributions

* **Find Meetings Feature**: Added the ability to search for a meeting
    * What it does: allows the user to search for a meeting using a specific property such as name, time, priority,
      and description.
      The search can also be done on a combination of these properties.
    * Justification: helps the user look for a meeting.

* **Sort Contacts Feature**: Added the ability to sort contacts
    * What it does: allows the user to sort the contact list using a specific property of the contacts
    * Justification: helps the user organize the contacts in a convenient way

* **Unsort Contacts Feature**: Added the ability to unsort contacts
    * What it does: allows the user to undo previous sort contacts commands. 
      The order of the contacts becomes the original order, which is determined by 
      the order they were inserted into the list.
    
* **Sort Meetings Feature**: Added the ability to sort meetings
    * What it does: allows the user to sort the meeting list using
