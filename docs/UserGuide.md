MeetBuddy is a **desktop app for managing contacts and daily meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, MeetBuddy can get your contacts and meetings management done faster than traditional GUI apps. In addition, MeetBuddy is meant for users to organise their meetups
with friends, family, or work colleagues. It provides a better user experience for users who have alot of contacts having online Gravatar accounts, where there is automatic syncing of
their profile pictures.

## General Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[g/GROUP]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `g/friend`, `g/friend g/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME ph/PHONE_NUMBER`, `ph/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `ph/12341234 ph/56785678`, only `ph/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* Note that for all date arguments, if the day is less than or equal to 31 and 
there is no such day corresponding to the given month and year of the date, the program is smart enough to handle 
 such cases and automatically corrects the date to the nearest valid end-of-month date. For example 
`31-02-2021` will be auto-corrected to `28-02-2021` because there is no such date. 
  But `32-02-2021` will not be autocorrected and the user will be prompted with an error message.

  in between of a meeting's start time and ending time (inclusive), 
  the search will return this specific meeting.

 consists of 7 rows, each row corresponds a day of a week in the timetable, which default is from 7 am to 6.59 am on the next day. 
 Each meeting is represented as an orange rectangular slot that will be placed in the timetable according to the following rules
 
 * If the meetings happen on a date corresponding to a column, it will be slotted into that column
 * The vertical axis if the timetable is the time, and slots are vertically placed according to their start time.
 * The length of the meeting slot is proportional to the timespan of the meeting.
 
 Note that it will correctly update and display all meetings. Meetings that fall outside the range of the timetable 
 will be filtered off. Some things to note:
 
 * Default when starting the application, the timetable will have the first ( leftmost column ) representing today's date.
 * Meetings can overlap across columns.
 * Setting small meeting times around the edge of the timetable will cause display issues, For example, setting a meeting 
 to 6:44-7:01 might cause display issues from the 7 - 7.01 will not display the date or time.
 * Note that you can scroll to view more slots.
 
 
### Set Timetable date : `setTimetable`

 today's current date. 
   
Examples:
* `setTimetable 2021-04-12` Set the time table to Apr 12th, 2021. You can check it by clicking Timetable in the GUI.
