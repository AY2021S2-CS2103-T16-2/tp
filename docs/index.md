**MeetBuddy** is a desktop app optimised for people who want to organise their meetings and their contacts.
They can store both meetings and contacts, view the meetings scheduled for the week, and take note of which contacts
they are meeting up with. It also allows users to assign notes to their meetings to keep people informed about meeting
details. Furthermore, it supports automatic syncing of contacts profile photos if they have a Gravatar account. The app is
targeted towards users with a daily 7am - 4pm schedule, have frequent meetings during this period, and prefer typing.
