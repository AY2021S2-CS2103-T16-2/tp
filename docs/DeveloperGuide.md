## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same personName as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component. Note that class diagram for TimetableView and MeetingDashboard are omitted
for clarity.](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Given below is another Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the more complicated command  `execute("showm1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `showm 1` Command](images/ShowPersonsInMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ShowMeetingCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the meeting book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Meeting>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the connection between the person in the address book and the meeting in the meeting book. e.g. Tom and July both participate in the CS2103 Lecture.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component. The full diagram for MeetingBook is omitted to make the figure less cluttered.](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the MeetBuddy data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Sort feature
It can be helpful to sort the list of contacts and the list of meetings by a certain criteria.
For example, sorting contacts by their names could complement the user experience.
However, there were a few implementations details to consider.

Currently, an essential attribute in the model are the filtered lists, 
which shows the results of searches and finds. 
The indexes used in commands like "edit" are taken with respect to these filtered list.
These filtered lists, however, are backed by immutable observable lists, 
which helps update the JavaFX GUI. I initially tried to make copies of these observable lists,
so that I can mutate them through sorting and filtering. However, this would not work,
since commands like "edit" would be making changes to a copy of the data, 
not the data itself.

The implementation I went with uses another subclass of observable lists called sorted lists.
It goes between the link between the original immutable observable list and the filtered lists.
Sorting would occur in the sorted list layer, and the filtering will be applied on top.
This has the benefit of still sharing the references with the original observable list, 
so modifications will still be reflected in the correct data structures.

###Timetable feature (author : Maurice Mok)

The timetable feature will be help the user visualise the free times, as well as his/her 
meetings schedule for the following week. 
It also aids the user in scheduling meetings faster or finding dates that she will be free on.
It should be responsive, such that when the user edits, adds or deletes a meeting, it should
be reflected in the timetable, if that meeting falls within the timetable range.
The user should be able to at a glance tell what meetings she has on a particular day in the 
timetable, and the timeslot of the meeting.
The user should be able to change the start date of the timetable. This allows to view a wider
range of days, as well as view past week schedules.



#### Design Considerations:

Two possible implementations were considered.

Alternative 1 : Represent a 7 day schedule as a 2 dimensional array with each cell representing a
30 minute time interval, with each row representing a day, and each column representing a specified 
timeslot within the day. Similar to a booking system, whenever a meeting is added or deleted,
it will mark the timeslots as taken, or free up the slots.

Pros: A Ui can listen to the model and the display can be updated quickly with each cell change.
Whenever a meeting is added or removed, it only takes O(1) time to check each timeslot occupied by
the meeting.

Cons: Takes up more space. Needs a lot of restrictions on handling meetings with not nice start and ending times,
and thus reduces a lot of flexibility for the user.

Alternative 2 (*Current Choice): 
Represent each day as a column in the GUI, for a total of 7 columns. Each meeting will be represented as a slot
of length proportional to the meeting duration. Depending on the meeting's start times and end times, 
the program will determine which column to slot the meeting in, as well as the vertical position in the column to
put the meeting.

Pros: More flexible in allowing users to display meetings with much more different start end times.
Takes up less space in the model.

Cons: It takes up more time for each operation to update the GUI, because you have to update at the very least 
a whole column, or search through the slots in the column to find the slot.





### Notes feature (has already been implemented, but will only be introduced in subsequent iterations)

The note feature has been implemented to help the user insert and delete personal notes.
This feature is introduced with the intention to help users manage their personal notes, and to make
MeetBuddy a more attractive one-stop application for users to manage their contacts, store their meeting 
information, and also keep track of various personal notes. While this feature has already been implemented,
it will only be made available in subsequent iterations, after the storage is made more mature for handling notes.

Just like the AddressBook for managing contacts and MeetingBook for managing meeting information, a NoteBook
was implemented for users to store personal notes. The NoteBook is implemented with a Command Pattern.

The user input command is first passed to the LogicManager class, which then makes use of the MeetBuddyParser
for deciding the type of command. Commands can be related to contacts, meetings, notes or timetable. This is decided
based on the command word. A specific command parser, such as AddNoteCommandParser, will be called which return
a Command such as AddNoteCommand. This command will be executed by the Logic Manager, before encapsulating
the result as a CommandResult object for passing back to the Model. The Ui component may then be invoked to display
the results (e.g. the notes) to the user.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature
=======
### Person Meeting Connection feature (Written by: Chen Yuheng (Github: skinnychenpi))
MeetBuddy allows users to track and record the contacts related with their meetings.
#### Implementation
A PersonMeetingConnection class stores all of the relevant information of persons in the contact related to certain meetings. The class diagram below shows how all the different components interact to allow the person meeting connection feature to function. Note that the XYZConnectionCommand and XYZConnectionCommandParser refers to all Connection related commands like add, delete etc.
![UndoRedoState0](images/PersonMeetingConnectionCommandClassDiagram.png)
A PersonMeetingConnection(PMC) slot is represented by the PMC class which contains 2 key attributes, personsInMeeting and meetingsInPerson. Both of them are HashMaps. The attribute personsInMeeting is a hashmap whose key is a Meeting object and its value is a UniquePersonList. Another attribute meetingsInPerson is reversed, whose key is a Person object and its value is a UniqueMeetingList.
>>>>>>> master

The XYZPMCCommand class represent classes that extend the abstract class Command and allows the users to add and delete the PMC to MeetBuddy. These XYZPMCCommands are created by the respective XYZPMCCommandParsers.

The PMC object is unique in the model, and it stores all the connections.

Given the class diagram and the understanding of how the PMC class interacts with other classes, let us examine how an addPersonMeetingConnection command behaves, by using the following activity diagram of the system.

![UndoRedoState0](images/AddPersonMeetingConnectionActivityDiagram.png)

The workflow above shows how a connection is added and the various checks that occurs at the different points throughout the workflow.

To summarize the above activity diagram, there are several key checks which MeetBuddy checks for when the user is adding a connection. Firstly, MeetBuddy checks if the index for the meeting and the prefix for person (p/) are presented in the command. Also, MeetBuddy checks if all prefixes present are formatted correctly. Then, it checks if the Meeting index provided is within the range of the Meeting list. Following which, MeetBuddy will check if the persons' indices passed for the prefixes are within the range.

#### Design Considerations
Create a Person Meeting Connection Class or Add new attributes into Person and Meeting (i.e Add meetingsRelated attribute into Person Class).

|       | Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Create a Person Meeting Connection Class | Alternative 1 : Add new attribute into Person and Meeting class|
| ------| ------------- | ------------- |
| Pros  | Don't need to modify the signatures for Person and Meeting classes' constructors and APIs. Reduce level of coupling for both classes. Easier to manage and access connection.  | The GUI is shown based on a meeting card, hence using this way is easier to shown as the personsRelated is stored in a meeting object. Easier for storage implementation. |
| Cons  | More difficult to manage storage, need to take care of the effect to PMC when either the meetings or persons changes.   | Increase the level of coupling and need to modify the codebase in a large scale. |

Reason for choosing Alternative 1: Due to the time constraint of this project, our group has decided to choose alternative 1, as it not only reduces coupling, but is sufficient for us to uniquely identify the Persons Related participating in the meeting.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Computing minor students in NUS who like typing, and is most of the week spent moving about meeting people for his internship, lectures, or social life, have busy workdays.
* Wants to manage school life and social life together in one app, with meetups for projects, lectures, social activities, and family all organised.
* Would like to keep track of contacts and organise them as well for easy searching and easy remembering.
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

Can manage social life and academics by toggling between two modes <-> school activities and non-school activities. Better time management - Priorities of meetups can be ranked and less time to schedule meetings with friends, as well as keep track of existing meetings.
Arrange activities with many people -> events not only tie with single contacts but with a group of contacts that can be added inside. Stay connected -> Keep in touch with old contacts or remove them by querying for old contacts . Keep a log and diary of past meetups, and small bios of people ,as well as images.

Users would be better able to manage their social and academic commitments by toggling between both modes. With the option to rank/prioritise meetups, users can experience better time management, and can stay connected with many people easily. The app also maintains a diary of past meetups, with the inclusion of images and bios of the people.



### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`
